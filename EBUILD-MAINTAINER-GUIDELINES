Hello,

This is a document which tries to set general guidelines for present and future
ebuild and repository maintainers.

The purpose of these guidelines is to make dealing with ebuilds simpler,
especially making decisions such as whether to delete or add a certain 
ebuild/version, as well as smooth the process of collaboration and ease of 
maintenance of the repository.

With time and experience, more guidelines will be added/changed/removed.

--- Documenting additions of ebuilds: ---

When adding a completely new ebuild (not just a version),
please add a file called Reasons in the ebuild's directory.
In this file add the date when you added the ebuild,
along with your name/nick and the reasons for adding the ebuild.

This should make it simpler for future maintainers to understand the 
point of an ebuild's existence and decide on appropriate actions.


--- Documenting variation from stock ebuilds: ---

Basically the same as the previous entry, except please add the difference
(not just semantically - this can be easily seen by running a diff) between
the stock ebuild and the new one, as well as the reasons/motivations
behind adding it versus using the standard one.

That's the list of guidelines for now. Please follow them for happy ebuild maintenance.
