app-office/openoffice
app-office/openoffice-l10n-*

Ebuild originally added Jun. 07, 2008
Added by Fabio Erculiani <lxnay@sabayonlinux.org>

The purpose is splitting localisations and application (openoffice).
These ebuilds ONLY work with app-office/openoffice (NOT the -bin!)
This is accomplished by editing app-office/openoffice removing localisation references
and creating a meta-ebuilds structure app-office/openoffice-l10n-*.
