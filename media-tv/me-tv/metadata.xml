  <longdescription>Me TV is a GNOME desktop application for watching digital television services that use the DVB standard. Me TV works with DVB-T, DVB-C, DVB-S and ATSC cards that have kernel driver support. Me TV uses the xine video player to render its output onto its video window but can be optionally compiled with libvlc, mplayer, libgstreamer and xine-lib engines. Me TV reads the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data that is transmitted over the air to populate a built-in program guide which can be used for scheduling recordings.</longdescription>
