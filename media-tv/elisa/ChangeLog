  28 Apr 2007; Daniel Gryniewicz <dang@gentoo.org> +elisa-0.1.6.ebuild:
  Bump to 0.1.6
  The Elisa team is happy to announce the 0.1.6 release of the Elisa
  home multimedia system.
  
  We fixed 2 crasher bugs in this release:
  
  - Under Ubuntu Feisty any attempt to close the elisa's DBus session
    would lead to a segfault, preventing the configuration from being written
    back to disk. We don't close the dbus session anymore, it's not even
    recommended in the DBus developer documentation (and now we know why).
  - If you were missing multimedia codecs to play a file, in some cases
    GStreamer would fail to parse the resulting error message, leading
    to an assertion error and a segfault of the application

  16 Apr 2007; Daniel Gryniewicz <dang@gentoo.org> +elisa-0.1.5.ebuild:
  Bump to 0.1.5
  - 2 new config options were added for the player to allow the user to
    customize how much seconds the player can seek
    forward/backward. Options are seek_forward_step and
    seek_backward_step.
  - a UPnP MediaRenderer plugin has been added, it allows Elisa to
    display media available on the network via UPnP. This plugin is
    still experimental, hence disabled by default.
  - Elisa is now more able to detect missing audio/video codecs and cancel
    media playback if anything is missing.
  - New Catalan translation by Josep Torra.

  16 Mar 2007; Daniel Gryniewicz <dang@gentoo.org> +elisa-0.1.4.2.ebuild:
  Bump to 0.1.4.2
  - the .desktop file has been fixed and is now valid. Elisa menu will
    appear in xdg compatible menus
  - Elisa now detects ogg theora files and is able to play them
  - the audio visualization effects are now disabled in the default
    configuration, this doesn't work well and need more work
  - Elisa now detects coldplugged devices (ex: usb disks plugged before
    elisa has been started)
  - next/previous track buttons have been added, allowing the user to
    skip track currently being played
  - a Last.FM_ webradios streaming client has been added, it allows
    Last.FM users to listen music via the Last.FM streaming platform.

  19 Feb 2007; Daniel Gryniewicz <dang@gentoo.org> elisa-0.1.4.1.ebuild:
  Oops, 0.1.1 for pigment version

  19 Feb 2007; Daniel Gryniewicz <dang@gentoo.org> +elisa-0.1.4.1.ebuild:
  Bump to 0.1.4.1
  - the media database system has been improved, one step further
    towards big media collections support
  - pictures/movies thumbnails are now compatible with Freedesktop
    specifications
  - the skin has been slightly improved in many places (new pictos,
    better animations, picture-folders icon compositing)
  - Pigment labels now display much better and are now scalable
  - The SDL Pigment backend has been replaced by a XWindow/GLX backend
