Bump to dvd95-1.5_p3. Fixes Gentoo #293041

New ebuild, added app-cdr/dvd95-1.5_p0 at the request of Wolfden.
This ebuild will provide functionality similar to K9copy, but is
gtk based, and has no KDE deps.

This application is in Gentoo's repository; however, Gentoo has fallen

behind on maintaining this ebuild, and is two versions behind.
This ebuild can be depricated if current ebuilds are picked up in 
Gentoo portage.
