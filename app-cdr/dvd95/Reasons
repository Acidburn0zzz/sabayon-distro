app-cdr/dvd95

Ebuild added March, 2009
Added by Mitch Harder <mitch.harder@sabayonlinux.org>

New ebuild, added app-cdr/dvd95-1.5_p0 at the request of Wolfden.
This ebuild will provide functionality similar to K9copy, but is
gtk based, and has no KDE deps.

This application is in Gentoo's repository; however, Gentoo has fallen
behind on maintaining this ebuild, and is two versions behind.

This ebuild can be depricated if current ebuilds are picked up in 
Gentoo portage.
