Ebuild added Jun. 20, 2008
Added by Wael Nasreddine <wael.nasreddine@sabayonlinux.org>

This ebuild has been added to provide patches from Debian/Ubuntu,
these patches will solve some problems with some video cards like i945GM.
NOTE: The patches won't be applied unless the USE flag "ubuntu-patches"
      is used, we don't want to force the user to apply them now would we?
