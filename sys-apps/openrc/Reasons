sys-apps/openrc

Ebuild originally added approx. Apr. 2008
Added by Kliakhandler Kosta <Kliakhandler@Kosta.tk>

The purpose was to rebrand the boot message from 'Gentoo ...'
to openrc to display 'Sabayon ...'.
This is accomplished by editing a certain defined variable in the ebuild.

======

31.5.08 - Added gentoo's new version (0.2.5) 
	with the branding changed to sabayon (Kliakhandler Kosta)
