Ebuild originally added approx. Apr. 2008
Added by Kliakhandler Kosta <Kliakhandler@Kosta.tk>

The purpose was to rebrand the boot message from 'Gentoo ...'
to openrc to display 'Sabayon ...'.
This is accomplished by editing a certain defined variable in the ebuild.

======
15.5.08 - Bumping the version to be in sync with gentoo's. Same difference.
